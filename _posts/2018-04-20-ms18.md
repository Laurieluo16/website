The MaxSat Evaluation is designed to provide a snapshot of current
progress in solving MaxSat by running submitted MaxSat solvers on a
heterogenous collection of benchmark instances.

MSE 2018 will be the 13th annual MaxSat Evaluation. We 
welcome contributions of two types from the community at large:

a) New MaxSAT benchmarks encoding instances of interesting
     NP-hard optimization problems, and

b) implementations of MaxSAT solvers that will be evaluated
    within MSE 2018 on a heterogenous collection of benchmarks.
