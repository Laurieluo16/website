## SUBMISSION OF WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops on topics in the field of computer science, related to logic in the broad sense. Each workshop proposal must indicate one affiliated conference of FLoC 2018.

It is strongly suggested that prospective workshop organizers contact the relevant conference workshop chair before submitting a proposal.

Each proposal should consist of the following two parts.

1) A short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list of previous or related workshops (if relevant). 

2) An organisational part including:

 - contact information for the workshop organizers;
 - proposed affiliated conference;
 - estimate of the number of workshop participants;
 - proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc.)
 - potential invited speakers;
 - procedures for selecting papers and participants;
 - plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);
 - duration (which may vary from one day to two days);
 - preferred period (pre, mid or post FLoC).
 
The FLoC Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted workshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of the hosting conferences and availability of space and facilities.

Proposals should be submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc2018workshops)

Please see the Workshop Guidelines page: http://www.floc2018.org/workshop-guidelines/ for further details and FAQ.
