This year, a new Sparkle SAT Challenge 2018 will be organised. 

Sparkle SAT Challenge 2018 is a novel competitive event that leverages cutting-edge automatically constructed algorithm selectors to assess the state of the art in solving the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, and to quantify contributions of individual solvers. The Sparkle challenge offers a chance for wide recognition for SAT solvers that perform well “across the board”, as well as for specialised solvers with excellent performance on specific types of instances. 

The Sparkle challenge is organised in close cooperation with the 2018 SAT Competition.
