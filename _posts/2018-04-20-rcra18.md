     The RCRA group (Knowledge Representation & Automated Reasoning) of
           the AI*IA (Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence)

                                organizes the

                             25th RCRA workshop:
               Experimental evaluation of algorithms for solving
               problems with combinatorial explosion  (RCRA 2018)

           workshop of the Federated Logic Conference 2018 (FLoC 2018)
                          http://www.floc2018.org/

    This event follows the series of the RCRA (Knowledge
    Representation and Automated Reasoning) annual meetings, held
    since 1994.  The success of the previous events shows that RCRA is
    becoming a major forum for exchanging ideas and proposing
    experimentation methodologies for algorithms in Artificial
    Intelligence.

### AIMS AND SCOPE

  Many problems in Artificial Intelligence show an exponential
  explosion of the search space.  Although stemming from different
  research areas in AI, such problems are often addressed with
  algorithms that have a common goal: the effective exploration of
  huge state spaces.  Many algorithms developed in one research area
  are applicable to other problems, or can be hybridized with
  techniques in other areas. Artificial Intelligence tools often
  exploit or hybridize techniques developed by other research
  communities, such as Operations Research.  In recent years, research
  in Artificial Intelligence has more and more focused on experimental
  evaluation of algorithms, the development of suitable methodologies
  for experimentation and analysis, the study of languages and the
  implementation of systems for the definition and solution of
  problems.

  Scope of the workshop is fostering the cross-fertilization of ideas
  stemming from different areas, proposing benchmarks for new
  challenging problems, comparing models and algorithms from an
  experimental viewpoint, and, in general, comparing different
  approaches with respect to efficiency, problem modeling, and ease of
  development.

  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  * Experimental evaluation of algorithms for
       - knowledge representation
       - automated reasoning
       - planning
       - scheduling
       - machine learning
       - model checking
       - boolean satisfiability (SAT)
       - constraint programming
       - argumentation
       - temporal reasoning
       - combinatorial optimization
       - quantified boolean formulae and quantified constraints
       - modal logics
       - logic programming
       - answer set programming 
       - ontological reasoning       
  * Definition and construction of benchmarks
  * Experimentation methodologies
  * Metaheuristics
  * Algorithm hybridization
  * Static analysis of combinatorial problems
  * Languages and systems for definition and solution of problems
  * Comparisons between systems and algorithms
  * Application experiences (visualization, graphics, security, transports,...)


### WORKSHOP CHAIRS

+  Marco Maratea         University of Genova, Italy
+  Mauro Vallati         University of Huddersfield, UK



### HOST ORGANIZATION

  Oxford University, UK


### SUBMISSIONS

  Authors are invited to submit either original (full or short)
  papers, or papers that appear on conference proceedings.

  Publications showing negative results are welcome, provided that the
  approach was original and very promising in principle, the
  experimentation was well-conducted, the results obtained were
  unforeseeable and gave important hints in the comprehension of the
  target problem, helping other researchers to avoid unsuccessful
  paths.

  The authors are requested to clearly specify whether their
  submission is original or already published. A footnote in the first
  page would suffice, and the type of submission can be specified also
  while registering/submitting the paper.

  Workshop submissions must be in PDF format, do not exceed 15 (for
  full papers) or 8 (for short papers) pages, and should be written in
  LaTeX, using the LNCS style.
  
  RCRA 2018 uses [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rcra18) for the submission of contributions.

  All submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the
  program committee.



### CONTACT

  In case of need, the workshop co-chairs can be contacted by sending
  an email to:
                   rcra2018[AT]easychair[DOT]org


### PROCEEDINGS

  Accepted original papers may be published online, as an issue of the
  CEUR-WS workshop proceeding series, AI*IA sub-series, provided that
  a sufficient amount of original accepted papers is collected.

  Moreover, as in [previous editions]
  (http://rcra.aixia.it/publications), we are considering the
  possibility of having workshop post-proceedings appearing in a
  special issue of an international journal, provided that a
  sufficient amount of high quality papers is collected.
