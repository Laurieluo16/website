The Theory Group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology is looking for a
postdoc in SAT solving.


The position is within the research group led by Jakob Nordstrom. Much of
the activities of this group revolve around the themes of efficient
algorithms for satisfiability in propositional logic (SAT solving) and lower
bounds on the efficiency of methods for reasoning about SAT (proof
complexity). On the practical side, one problem of interest is to gain a
better understanding of, and improve, the performance of current
state-of-the-art SAT solvers --- in particular, solvers using
conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL). We are even more interested in
exploring new techniques that hold out the theoretical possibility of
exponential improvements over CDCL, but seem hard to implement efficiently
in practice, e.g., algebraic methods such as Groebner bases or geometric
methods such as pseudo-Boolean solving.


The application deadline is September 24, 2017. See 
[the full announcement](http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/D-2017-0455-Eng.php) 
with more information and instructions how to apply. Informal
enquiries are welcome and may be sent to jakobn@kth.se .
