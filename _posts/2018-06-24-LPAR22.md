The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning, computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 22nd LPAR will be held will be held in Haile Resort, Awassa, Ethiopia, 16-21 November 2018. The proceedings will be published by EasyChair Publications, in the EPiC Series in Computing. The volume will be open access and the authors will retain copyright.

# Safety:
-------

We are aware of the US State Department's travel advisory. Please be assured that Awassa is not in any of the areas mentioned, and there is no need for any concern. Our local arrangments person emailed us "I can say with hundred percent of certainty Ethiopia is fully safe. Nothing to worry. I was talking to you before about the most remote areas where I took my tourists, which are totally safe now. Even there has been never a problem in Awassa.".

# Topics:
-------

New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are welcome. Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and practices. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

# Submission details:
-------------------

Submissions of two kinds are welcome:

* Regular papers that describe solid new research results. They can be up to 15 pages long in EasyChair style, including figures but excluding references and appendices (that reviewers are not required to read).
 
* Experimental and tool papers that describe implementations of systems, report experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented systems. They can be up to 8 pages long in the EasyChair style.

Both types of papers must be electronically submitted in PDF via EasyChair:
