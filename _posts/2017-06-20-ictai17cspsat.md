                   Special Track on SAT and CSP 

                                     at the 

    29th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence
    IEEE ICTAIí2017, Boston, MA, USA, November 06-08, 2017


Constraint Programming (CP) and Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) are two related
major topics of research in Artificial Intelligence.  They have proved to be
the most efficient techniques at the heart of general-purpose combinatorial
problem solving, with application ranging from automation of logics,
verification, planning and scheduling, both in academic research and industry.

Over the years, the ICTAI conference has become a major forum for the CSP and
SAT research communities for presenting new high-quality results.  The special
track SAT/CSP@ICTAI2017 is intended to be a forum for new ideas and techniques
using satisfiability and constraint solving.  It particularly welcomes new core
solving techniques, extensions to other domains of AI and applications.  


Topics 
===== 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

+ SAT, SMT and CSP Solvers
+ Modeling, methodologies and tools 
+ Implementation of solvers and global constraints 
+ Applications of CSP and SAT-based technologies 
+ Complete, incomplete and hybrid search techniques, heuristics, metaheuristics
+ AI techniques based on SAT and CSP 
+ Tractable classes of problems, FPT, decompositions
+ Soft and weighted constraints, optimization, MAX-SAT, MAX-CSP
+ Machine learning, deep learning in SAT and CSP
+ Social network engineering with SAT and CSP


Submissions 
========== 

Papers must be full papers up to 8 pages and follow the standard IEEE formatting
instructions for conference papers (single-spaced, double-column, 10-point font
size). 

Papers must be submitted in pdf only through the Easychair special track
submission page (https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictai2017).  See
submission instructions in http://ictai2017.org/submission.htm

All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.
Papers must report high-quality original work, be unpublished and not submitted
elsewhere during the whole ICTAI review process.

Each accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors and accompanied by
at least one full ICTAI 2017 registration fee payment, to guarantee publication
in the proceedings. 


Proceedings and Special Journal Issue 
============================= 

All papers accepted in the CSP and SAT technologies special track will be
included in the ICTAI 2017 main proceedings published by the IEEE Computer
Society.  Extended versions of the best papers are expected to be invited for
publication in a special issue of an international journal after an additional
round of reviews. 


Important Dates 
============ 

+ Paper submission: June 25,   2017
+ Notification:     July 25,   2017 
+ Camera-ready:     August 25, 2017
