    --- SAT 2020 ---
    23rd International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing
    July 5-9, 2020, Alghero, Italy
    https://sat2020.idea-researchlab.org/

    CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for
researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the
propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition
to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean
optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints),
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear
connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

We invite proposals for workshops associated to the main conference
program of SAT 2020. The workhops will be held on 5 July 2020, the day
before the main conference starts.

## SUBMISSION OF WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

Proposals should be submitted in PDF format and sent by e-mail to
Florian Lonsing (SAT 2020 Workshop Chair).

Proposals should consist of two parts. First, a short scientific
justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the
particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a
list of previous or related workshops (if relevant). A second,
organizational part should include:

* Contact information of the workshop organizers
* Estimate of the audience size
* Proposed format and agenda (for example, paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc.)
* Potential invited speakers
* Procedures for selecting talks and participants
* Plans for dissemination, if any (for example, proceedings or special issue of journals)
* duration: half day or full day
* Relevant chairing experience of the organizers (if any)
* Organizing committee members (if already known)
