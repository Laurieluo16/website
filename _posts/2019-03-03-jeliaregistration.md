### JELIA 2019 CONFERENCE

The 16th edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial
Intelligence will take place from May 7 to 11 in Cosenza, organised by
the Department of Mathemathics and Computer Science of University of
Calabria.

Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis
for the study and development of applications and systems in
Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms,
methodologies, and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger
than ever.

The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (or
Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle -
JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in response to the need for
a European forum for the discussion of emerging work in this field.
Since then, JELIA has been organised biennially, with proceedings
published in the Springer-Verlag series Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence. Previous meetings took place in Roscoff, France (1988),
Amsterdam, Netherlands (1990), Berlin, Germany (1992), York, UK
(1994), Évora, Portugal (1996), Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), Málaga,
Spain (2000), Cosenza, Italy (2002), Lisbon, Portugal (2004),
Liverpool, UK (2006), Dresden, Germany (2008), Helsinki, Finland
(2010), Toulouse, France (2012), Madeira, Portugal (2014), Larnaca,
Cyprus (2016).

The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with
growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall
technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for
the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.
