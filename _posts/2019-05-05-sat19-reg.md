                       CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

              Twenty-second International Conference on
          THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF SATISFIABILITY TESTING
                          --- SAT 2019 ---

                  Lisbon, Portugal, 7 - 12 July 2019

         http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/registration.html

             Early Registration:  8 June, 2019, 23:59 AoE
              Late Registration: 30 June, 2019, 23:59 AoE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for
researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the
propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition
to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean
optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints),
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear
connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

Many hard combinatorial problems can be tackled using SAT-based
techniques including problems that arise in Formal Verification,
Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, Computational Biology,
Cryptography, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Mathematics, etc. Indeed,
the theoretical and practical advances in SAT research over the past
twenty years have contributed to making SAT technology an
indispensable tool in a variety of domains.

SAT 2019 aims to further advance the field by soliciting original
theoretical and practical contributions in these areas with a clear
connection to satisfiability. Specifically, SAT 2019 invites
scientific contributions addressing different aspects of SAT
interpreted in a broad sense, including (but not restricted to)
theoretical advances (such as exact algorithms, proof complexity, and
other complexity issues), practical search algorithms, knowledge
compilation, implementation-level details of SAT solvers and SAT-based
systems, problem encodings and reformulations, applications (including
both novel application domains and improvements to existing
approaches), as well as case studies and reports on findings based on
rigorous experimentation.

## Registration

Early registration for both the conference and workshops is now available. We
encourage all potential attendees to register soon! After June 8, the prices

## Attending SAT 2019

### Venue<sup>3</sup>

The conference will take place at [Fundação Calouste
Gulbenkian](https://gulbenkian.pt/). Established in perpetuity, the
Foundation’s main purpose is to improve the quality of life through art,
charity, science and education. The Foundation has a museum, which houses the
Founder’s private collection, alongside a collection of modern and
contemporary art; an orchestra and a choir; an art library and archive; a
scientific research institute; and a garden, in a central area of the city of
Lisbon, where educational activities also take place.

More information about the venue and the social program of the conference can
be found [here](http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/venue.html).

<sup>3</sup> The Summer School and the workshops will take place at the
[Instituto Superior Técnico (IST/UL)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) of the
[University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en/).

### Visa

Portugal is part of the [Schengen
area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area). Please verify whether you
need a Schengen visa before your trip.

If you require a visa, we recommend contacting the nearest embassy, consulate,
or travel agency for information about the passport and visa requirements from
your country for entry to Portugal (Schengen). If you need an invitation
letter for visa purposes, then write in due time to
[chairs@sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt](mailto:chairs@sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt).

Unfortunately, we require the following information in order to avoid visa
fraud:

*Students*: brief reference letter from your supervisor including contact
details for the University.

*Non-students*: the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of at least one
publication in scope of the SAT conference OR some other evidence of your
affiliation with SAT (e.g reference letter from employer).

## SAT/SMT/AR Summer School 2019

Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Automated
Reasoning (AR) continue to make rapid advances and find novel uses in a wide
variety of applications, both in computer science and beyond. The [SAT/SMT/AR
Summer School](http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/smtschool.html) aims to bring
a select group of students up to speed quickly in this exciting research area.
The school continues the successful line of Summer Schools that ran from 2011
to 2015 as SAT/SMT Summer Schools and added AR in 2016.

## Competitions
