The SAT association is seeking proposals for hosting and organizing SAT'19. 

Proposals or intentions to host SAT'18 have to be sent to the board of the
SAT association, which consists of

+  Fahiem Bacchus <fbacchus@cs.toronto.edu> (chair)
+  Armin Biere <biere@jku.at> (vice-chair)
+  Hans Kleine Buening <kbcsl@upb.de> (treasurer)

by Sunday, July 1st, 2018 (anywhere on earth).

The steering committee will take votes on the proposals and a single
winner is determined by instant-runoff voting, also known as
preferential voting.  If there is a tie, then the chair of the
association has an additional vote.

Preferential votes will be collected by the chair from the steering
committee members non-anonymously, also non-anonymously shared among
the board members and then published anonymously together with the
result of the voting.

The steering committee consists of the chairs of the last four conferences
(SAT'13 - SAT'17).

+ Serge Gaspers
  UNSW Sydney and Data61, CSIRO
+ Toby Walsh
  UNSW Sydney and Data61, CSIRO
+ Daniel Le Berre
  Universit√© d'Artois, France
+ Nadia Creignou
  Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Marseille, France
+ Marijn Heule
  The University of Texas at Austin, USA
+ Sean Weaver
  Trusted Systems Research Group, USA
+ Uwe Egly
  Vienna Institute of Technology, Austria
+ Carsten Sinz
  Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany

A proposal should discuss: date, duration (week days), location,
organizers (with specific mention of who will serve as program
chairs), available administrative support, concept (conference, summer
school, workshops, etc.), catering (lunch and coffee), social events,
banquet, expected registration cost, accommodation (hotels, dorms),
etc.  We would also appreciate concrete proposals to co-locate with
smaller or bigger conferences.

In general we try to organize the process of selecting place and
chairs of the conference as open and democratic as possible.  Also
please feel free to explore with the board or any member of the
steering committee any interest you might have in hosting, and we will
be happy to provide guidance.
