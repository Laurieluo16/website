	                  PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

	The 9th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning, IJCAR 2018
	      Oxford, UK, July 14-17, 2018. http://www.ijcar2018.org/

	        Part of The Federated Logic Conference, FLoC 2018,
	      Oxford, UK, July 6-19, 2018.  http://www.floc2018.org/
	                     -----------------------

IJCAR is the premier international joint conference on all topics in
automated reasoning. The IJCAR technical program will consist of
presentations of high-quality original research papers, system
descriptions, and invited talks.

IJCAR 2018 takes place as part of FLoC 2018 and is the merger of
leading events in automated reasoning:

  - CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction),
  - FroCoS (Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems) and
  - TABLEAUX (Conference on Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods)

# Topics:
-------

IJCAR 2018 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated
reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and
applications. Original research papers and descriptions of working
automated deduction systems are solicited.

IJCAR topics include the following ones:

- Logics of interest include: propositional, first-order, classical,
  equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal,
  temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, type theory, etc.

- Methods of interest include: tableaux, sequent calculi, resolution,
  model-elimination, inverse method, paramodulation, term rewriting,
  induction, unification, constraint solving, decision procedures,
  model generation, model checking, semantic guidance, interactive
  theorem proving, logical frameworks, AI-related methods for
  deductive systems, proof presentation, automated theorem provers,
  combination of decision procedures, SAT and SMT solving, etc.

- Applications of interest include: verification, formal methods,
  program analysis and synthesis, computer mathematics, declarative
  programming, deductive databases, knowledge representation, etc.

We welcome papers combining automated-reasoning formalisms &
techniques and with those from other areas of CS and mathematics
--including, e.g., computer algebra, machine learning, formal
languages, formal verification, termination.
In particular, high-quality conference papers on the topics of the
IJCAR 2018 affiliated workshops are welcome.

The proceedings of IJCAR 2018 will be published by Springer in the
LNAI/LNCS series (www.springer.com/lncs).

# Submission details:
-------------------

Submission is electronic, through [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2018).

Authors are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX and the Springer "llncs" format, which can be obtained from [http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html](http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html)

We solicit two categories of submissions:

## REGULAR PAPERS. 
  
  Submissions, not exceeding sixteen (16) pages
  including bibliography, should contain original research, and
  sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the
  contribution. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are
  strongly encouraged to make their data and software available with
  their submission for reproducibility. The PC will take availability
  of software and data into account when evaluating submissions.
  Submissions reporting on case studies in an industrial context are
  strongly invited, and should describe details, weaknesses and
  strength in sufficient depth. Simultaneous submission to other
  conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has
  already been published elsewhere is not allowed.

## SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS. 
  
  Submissions, not exceeding eight (8) pages
  including bibliography, should describe the implemented tool and its
  novel features. One author is expected to be able to perform a
  demonstration on demand to accompany a tool presentation. Papers
  describing tools that have already been presented in other
  conferences before will be accepted only if significant and clear
  enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.

# Best paper award:
-----------------

IJCAR 2018 will recognize the most outstanding submission with a best
paper award at the conference.
